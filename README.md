# Documentation

## Notice

Important notice: I have completely refactored it to remove some unnecessary plugins. And made a lot of optimizations for the structure.

If you still want to continue to use the previous configuration, you can choose the [v0.01](https://github.com/askfiy/nvim/releases/tag/V0.01) version.

## Features

- Completely written in Lua language
- Rich functions
- Ultimate performance
- Lots of tweaks for every theme
- Excellent scalability

## illustrate

This is a Neovim configuration written in pure Lua, with good extensibility and a very easy-to-understand configuration (I refactored it entirely in Lua and made sure to remove all viml).

Now it should be stable and fast, I do lazy loading for 99% of the plugins and it should start in between 20ms - 70ms depending on your PC's configuration.

Really does it lightning fast ⚡️.

With the completion of the refactoring, this configuration will be stable and long-term use.

Currently, it supports the following languages:

- Python
- Golang
- Node
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Vue
- Json
- SQL
- Markdown

Please file a PR if you configure a new LSP or DAP.

Also, any questions can be raised, it has just been refactored and some features have not been tested.

Make sure you have the above dependencies installed, then execute the command below

```
$ cd ~/.config/
$ mv nvim ./nvim-bak -- if you haven't configured Neovim yourself, this step can be omitted
$ git clone https://github.com/askfiy/nvim
```

When you open neovim for the first time, it will automatically download all plugins and LSP servers, this process may take 1-2 minutes. please wait patiently ...

## Disabled plugins

### Tabnine

[Tabnine](https://github.com/tzachar/cmp-tabnine) is disabled for performance reasons, you can search for Tabnine in the [lua/core/plugins.lua](./lua/core/plugins.lua) file and open it.

```
["tzachar/cmp-tabnine"] = { -- AI smart completion (it may affect performance)
    -- comment the line below
    disable = true,
    run = "./install.sh",
    after = { "nvim-cmp" },
},
```

Enter `:PackerSync` to install the plugin. After the installation is complete, an error may occur. You need to execute the following command:

```
$ ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/opt/cmp-tabnine/install.sh
```

### Copillot

For performance reasons, the [copillot](https://github.com/github/copilot.vim) plugin is also disabled by default, you can turn it on as well.

After entering the `:PackerSync` command, you can enter `:Copilot setup` .

It will return you a string of verification codes, which you need to record and enter in your browser.

## Extension

### Add New plugin

Add the new plugins you want to use in [lua/core/plugins](./lua/core/plugins.lua).

Note that if your newly installed plugin requires a configuration file, and the plugin is written in viml, you must declare it like this:

```
-- If it is a Lua plugin, this is not required
["plugin_author/plugin_name"] = {
    ptp = "viml"
}
```

Then you can create configuration files in the [lua/configure/plugins](./lua/configure/plugins/) directory.

The configuration file must start with `nv_` and end with `.lua`, such as `nv_plugin_name.lua`.

The plugin writing template of viml type is as follows:

```
local M = {}

function M.entrance()
end

return M
```

If it is a plugin written in Lua, you need to use the following template:

```
local M = {}

function M.before() end

function M.load()
    local ok, m = pcall(require, "m")
    if not ok then
        return
    end

    M.m = m
    M.m.setup({config})
end

function M.after() end

return M
```

The reason for this is that you can manage your plugins more easily, so I recommend it.

### Add Lsp config

To add a new LSP configuration, please add a new configuration file in the [lua/configure/lsp/](./lua/configure/lsp/) directory.

The configuration file template is as follows:

```
return {
    hooks = {
        ---@diagnostic disable-next-line: unused-local
        attach = function(client, bufnr)
            -- This is required, you don't have to write anything.
            -- Here you can do things that only target the current LSP server when you need it
        end,
    },
    options = {
        -- LSP configuration goes here
    },
}
```

Then you need to add a new configuration to [lua/configure/plugins/nv_nvim-lsp-installer.lua](./lua/configure/plugins/nv_nvim-lsp-installer.lua)

```
M.language_servers_config = {
    lsp_name = require("configure.lsp.your_lsp_config_file_name")
}
```

### Add Dap config

To add a new Dap configuration, please add a new configuration file in the [lua/configure/dap/](./lua/configure/dap/) directory.

The configuration file template is as follows:

```
return {
    names = {
            -- Some debuggers have different names for adapters and configurations
            -- so you have to specify it here, it's required
            adapters = "adapters_name",
            configurations = "configurations_name",
        },
    adapters = {
        ...
    },
    configurations = {
        ...
    },
}
```

Then you need to add a new configuration to [lua/configure/plugins/nv_nvim-dap.lua](lua/configure/plugins/nv_nvim-dap.lua)

```
M.dubug_adapter_config = {
    ...
    arbitrary_name = require("configure.dap.your_dap_config_file_name"),
}
```

## Key bindings

### Diff keymap

The default `leader` is `space`, you can check the [lua/core/mapping.lua](./lua/core/mapping.lua) file to see the basic key bindings.

Some vim or neovim default keys have been replaced, namely:

- `"n" <c-u>` : now it will move up 10 lines instead of half the display area
- `"n" <c-d>` : now it will move down 10 lines instead of half the display area
- `"n" <c-e>` : now it will move the current buffer to the left instead of scrolling up a line
- `"n" <c-y>` : now it will move the current display area to the right instead of scrolling down a line
- `"n" <c-l>` : now he will focus on the left buffer instead of clearing the search highlight

The following is a description of the basic keys:

```
-  "i" jj                 :  Escape editor insert mode
-  "t" <esc>              :  Escape terminal insert mode
-  "n" <c-u>              :  Move 10 lines up
-  "n" <c-d>              :  Move 10 lines down
-  "n" <m-k>              :  Reduce horizontal split screen size
-  "n" <m-j>              :  Increase horizontal split screen size
-  "n" <m-h>              :  Reduce vertical split screen size
-  "n" <m-l>              :  Increase vertical split screen size
-  "n" <leader>cs         :  Enable or disable spell checking
-  "c" <m-p>              :  Look up history
-  "c" <m-n>              :  Look down history
-  "n", "x" k             :  Move up one line
-  "n", "x" j             :  Move down one line
-  "n", "x" H             :  Move to the first character at the beginning of the line
-  "n", "x" L             :  Move to the last character at the end of the line
-  "i", "c", "t" <m-w>    :  Jump to next word in insert mode
-  "i", "c", "t" <m-b>    :  Jump to previous word in insert mode
- -  "i", "c", "t" <m-j>  :  Move cursor down in insert mode "i", "c", "t" <m-k>  :  Move cursor up in insert mode
-  "i", "c", "t" <m-h>    :  Move cursor left in insert mode
-  "i", "c", "t" <m-l>    :  Move cursor right in insert mode

```

### Manager keymap

`<leader>1`, `<leader>2`, `<leader>3`, `<leader>4` Can open some specific functions.

```
- "n" <leader>1  : Open File Explorer
- "n" <leader>2  : Open Outilne Explorer
- "n" <leader>3  : Open Undo Explorer
- "n" <leader>4  : Open Database Explorer
```

- File Exporer is [Nvim-tree](https://github.com/kyazdani42/nvim-tree.lua), you can press `g?` for help.
- Outline Explorer is [aerial](https://github.com/stevearc/aerial.nvim), you can press `?` for help.
- Undo Explorer is [undotree](https://github.com/mbbill/undotree), you can press `?` for help.
- Database Explorer is [vim-dadbod-ui](https://github.com/kristijanhusak/vim-dadbod-ui), you can press `?` for help.

### Buffer keymap

It is a very good idea to manage all buffers via the [bufferline](https://github.com/akinsho/bufferline.nvim) and [bufferdelete](https://github.com/famiu/bufdelete.nvim) plugins , here is my keymap, usually they start with `<leader>b`:

```
-  "n" <c-q>       :  Close current buffer
-  "n" <c-h>       :  Go to left buffer
-  "n" <c-l>       :  Go to right buffer
-  "n" <c-e>       :  Move current buffer to left
-  "n" <c-y>       :  Move current buffer to right
-  "n" <leader>bh  :  Close all left buffers
-  "n" <leader>bl  :  Close all right buffers
-  "n" <leader>bo  :  Close all other buffers
-  "n" <leader>ba  :  Close all buffers
-  "n" <leader>bt  :  Go to buffer *
-  "n" <leader>bs  :  Buffers sort (by extension)
-  "n" <leader>b1  :  Go to buffer 1
-  "n" <leader>b2  :  Go to buffer 2
-  "n" <leader>b3  :  Go to buffer 3
-  "n" <leader>b4  :  Go to buffer 4
-  "n" <leader>b5  :  Go to buffer 5
-  "n" <leader>b6  :  Go to buffer 6
-  "n" <leader>b7  :  Go to buffer 7
-  "n" <leader>b8  :  Go to buffer 8
-  "n" <leader>b9  :  Go to buffer 9
```

### LSP keymap

LSP-related keys are usually prefixed with `g` or `<leader>c`, I prefer to use `<leader>c` as `code operate` to memorize.
Here are the default keys I bind:

```
-  "n" <leader>ca  :  Show code action
-  "n" <leader>cn  :  Variable renaming
-  "n" <leader>cf  :  Format buffer
-  "n" gI          :  Go to implementations
-  "n" gD          :  Go to type definitions
-  "n" gd          :  Go to definitions
-  "n" gr          :  Go to references
-  "n" gh          :  Show help information
-  "n" go          :  Show Workspace Diagnostics
-  "n" [g          :  Jump to prev diagnostic
-  "n" ]g          :  Jump to next diagnostic
-  "i" <c-j>       :  Toggle signature help
```

### Code Completion

It's nice to use [nvim-cmp](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp) with [vim-vsnip](https://github.com/hrsh7th/vim-vsnip) for code completion, it's very fast and stable, here are my default keybindings:

```
- "i" <c-k> : Toggle completion menu
- "i" <c-p> : select the previous completion suggestion
- "i" <c-n> : select the next completion suggestion
- "i" <c-d> : select the fifth completion suggestion below
- "i" <c-u> : select the fifth completion suggestion above
- "i" <cr>  : confirm current suggestion
- "i" <tab> : similar to vscode, if you do not enter the completion menu, select the next item, if you enter the completion menu, select the current item
- "i" <c-b> : scroll up the floating window
- "i" <c-f> : scroll down the floating window
```

Additionally, `<tab>` and `<s-tab>` can also be used in fragments, which behave the same as in vscode:

```
- "i" <tab> : jump backward
- "i" <s-tab> : jump forward
```

### Debug

Code debugging currently only supports Python and Golang, through [nvim-dap](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap) and [https://github.com/rcarriga/nvim-dap-ui]() And the combination of [nvim-dap-virtual-text](https://github.com/theHamsta/nvim-dap-virtual-text) gives me an IDE-like debugging experience.

I use `<leader>d` to enable code debugging, all `<f>` keys will only take effect after you actually enable debug mode: 

```
-  "n" <leader>db  :  Mark or delete breakpoints
-  "n" <leader>dc  :  Clear breakpoints in the current buffer
-  "n" <leader>du  :  Toggle debug ui
-  "n" <leader>de  :  Execute debug expressions
-  "n" <F5>        :  Enable debugging or jump to the next breakpoint
-  "n" <F6>        :  Step into
-  "n" <F7>        :  Step over
-  "n" <F8>        :  Step out
-  "n" <F9>        :  Rerun debug
-  "n" <F10>       :  Close debug
```

Additionally, you can enter expressions by pressing `i` in the `repl` window.

### Find

All lookups are prefixed with `<leader>f`.

Currently it supports some of the following searches, and you can define more search methods.

```
-  "n" <leader>ff  :  Find files in the current workspace
-  "n" <leader>fg  :  Find string in the current workspace
-  "n" <leader>fo  :  Find telescope history
-  "n" <leader>fh  :  Open last lookup
-  "n" <leader>ft  :  Find all help document tags
-  "n" <leader>fm  :  Find marks in the current workspace
-  "n" <leader>fi  :  Find all neovim highlights
-  "n" <leader>fb  :  Find all buffers
-  "n" <leader>f/  :  Find all search history
-  "n" <leader>f:  :  Find all command history
-  "n" <leader>fs  :  Find all session
-  "n" <leader>fn  :  Show notices history
-  "n" <leader>fd  :  Find todo tag in the current workspace
-  "n" <leader>fy  :  Show Clipboard History
-  "n" <leader>fc  :  Find the current file and open it in file explorer
```

They are provided by the following plugins respectively:

- [Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim)
- [nvim-notify](https://github.com/rcarriga/nvim-notify)
- [todo-comments.nvim](https://github.com/folke/todo-comments.nvim)
- [nvim-neoclip.lua](https://github.com/AckslD/nvim-neoclip.lua)
- [persisted.nvim](https://github.com/olimorris/persisted.nvim)
- [nvim-tree](https://github.com/kyazdani42/nvim-tree.lua)

### Git

You can use `<leader>g` to view Git information in the current file, for Git management, I would use lazygit instead of any plugin for neovim.

These functions are provided by [gitsigns.nvim](https://github.com/lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim):

```
-  "n" [c               :  Jump to the prev hunk
-  "n" ]c               :  Jump to the next hunk
-  "n" <leader>gl       :  Toggle current line blame
-  "n" <leader>gh       :  Show current block blame
-  "n" <leader>gD       :  Show deleted lines
-  "n" <leader>gd       :  Open deff view
-  "n" <leader>gR       :  Reset current buffer
-  "n", "v" <leader>gr  :  Reset current hunk
```

### Replace

The full workspace fuzzy string search and replace of vscode is very easy to use, there is also a corresponding plugin in neovim, I set its prefix key to `<leader>r`.

Also, after entering the fuzzy search and replace interface, you can use `?` to get more help.

This functionality is provided by [nvim-spectre](https://github.com/nvim-pack/nvim-spectre):

```
-  "n" <leader>rp  :  Replace characters in all files in the current workspace
-  "n" <leader>rf  :  Replace all characters in the current file
-  "n" <leader>rw  :  Replace the character under the cursor in all files under the current workspace
```

### Session

Restoring the working state after reopening the IDE is a feature that modern editors should have. You can directly use `<leader>sl` to restore the last session record.

In addition, `<leader>s` is also bound to some other keys.

This functionality is provided by [persisted.nvim](https://github.com/olimorris/persisted.nvim):

```
-  "n" <leader>ss  :  Save session
-  "n" <leader>sd  :  Delete session
-  "n" <leader>sl  :  Load session
```

### Terminal

The prefix key for the integrated terminal is `<leader>t`, the integrated terminal experience brought by the [toggleterm.nvim](https://github.com/akinsho/toggleterm.nvim) plugin is very good:

```
- "n" <leader>tt : Toggle bottom or vertical terminal
- "n" <leader>tf : Toggle floating terminal
- "n" <leader>tv : Toggle vertical terminal
- "n" <leader>tg : Toggle lazygit terminal (requires lazygit installed)
- "n" <leader>ta : Toggle all terminal
```

The floating terminal and lazygit terminal can only open one, but the bottom terminal and side terminal can open many.

The default terminal number opened by `<leader>tt` is `1`, if you want to open a new terminal, please enter `{count}<leader>tt`

Notice! floating terminal number is 120, lazygit terminal number is 130.

### Translate

Well, translated commands are also prefixed with `<leader>t`. [translate.nvim](https://github.com/uga-rosa/translate.nvim) is definitely the best translation plugin I've ever seen.

```
-  "n", "x" <leader>tcs  :  Translate English to Chinese and open in split window
-  "n", "x" <leader>tcr  :  Translate English to Chinese and replace English
-  "n", "x" <leader>tcf  :  Translate English to Chinese and open in float window
-  "n", "x" <leader>tci  :  Translate English to Chinese and insert to next line
-  "n", "x" <leader>tcc  :  Translate English to Chinese and copy result to clipboard
-  "n" <leader>tcb       :  Translate English comment to Chinese and open in float window
-  "n" <leader>tcw       :  Translate English word to Chinese and open in float window

-  "n", "x" <leader>tes  :  Translate Chinese to English and open in split window
-  "n", "x" <leader>ter  :  Translate Chinese to English and replace Chinese
-  "n", "x" <leader>tef  :  Translate Chinese to English and open in float window
-  "n", "x" <leader>tei  :  Translate Chinese to English and insert to next line
-  "n", "x" <leader>tec  :  Translate Chinese to English and copy result to clipboard
-  "n" <leader>teb       :  Translate Chinese comment to English and open in float window
-  "n" <leader>tew       :  Translate Chinese word to English and open in float window
```

If you want to change the language, you can open the [/lua/configure/plugins/nv_translate.lua](./lua/configure/plugins/nv_translate.lua) file and change the mapping.

Finally, don't forget to modify the key grouping description in the [/lua/configure/plugins/nv_which-key.lua](./lua/configure/plugins/nv_which-key.lua) file.

### Upload

There are some buttons that can upload pictures to the Internet, and a makrdown picture link will be generated after the upload is complete。

[nvim-picgo](https://github.com/askfiy/nvim-picgo) is the first neovim plugin I wrote myself and I love it.

The prefix is `<leader>u`.

```
-  "n" <leader>uc  :  Upload image from clipboard
-  "n" <leader>uf  :  Upload image from disk file
```

### Multiple cursors

It is common to quickly select a range of words and make changes. Here are the key bindings for multi-cursor mode:

```
"n" <tab> : Toggle between normal and visual mode
"n" <c-n> : Select down
"n" <c-s> : Skip selection
"n" <c-p> : Delete the current selection
"n" <m-p> : Create cursor down
"n" <m-n> : Create cursor up
"n" <esc> : Exit Multiple cursors mode
```

The plugin that provides multi-cursor mode is [vim-visual-multi](https://github.com/mg979/vim-visual-multi).

### Surround

It is very common to change `"` to `'` or `()` to `[]`.

You can make quick changes using the following keys:

```
"n" ys{range}{char} : Add Surround
"n" cs{char}{char}  : Changne Surround
"n" cq              : Toggle Surround
"n" ds{char}        : Delete Surround
visual s            : Add Surround
```

This feature is provided by [surround.nvim](https://github.com/ur4ltz/surround.nvim), in addition, you can also use the `.` command to repeat the last modified surround work, which is provided by [vim-repeat ](https://github.com/tpope/vim-repeat).

### Comment

Good code needs to use comments, you can press the following shortcut keys to quickly add comments：

```
"n" gcc : Toggle line comment
"n" gcb : Toggle block comment
"n" gca : Insert line comment to line end
"n" gcj : Insert line comment to next line
"n" gck : Insert line comment to previous line
"n" gb{range} : Switch the specified line to a block comment

"v" gc  : Toggle line comment
"v" gb  : Toggle block comment
```

In addition, in some single-file multi-language environments (such as Vue), it also supports switching annotations according to context.

Well, these functions are provided by [Comment.nvim](https://github.com/numToStr/Comment.nvim) and [nvim-ts-context-commentstring](https://github.com/JoosepAlviste/nvim-ts-context-commentstring).

### Switch

It is common to quickly change `True` to `False`. Switching can be done quickly with `gs`.

If you want to add some words, you can edit the [lua/configure/plugins/nv_switch.lua](./lua/configure/plugins/nv_switch.lua) file.

As you can see, this feature is supported without the [switch](https://github.com/AndrewRadev/switch.vim) plugin.

### Emment

Use `<c-f>,` to quickly expand emment fragments.

`<c-f>` has some other functions, but it only works with certain types of files:

### Motions

With the [Hop](https://github.com/phaazon/hop.nvim) plugin, you can quickly jump to any position in the buffer:

```
-  "n", "v" ss  :  Jump to word head
-  "n", "v" sl  :  Jump to line
-  "n", "v" sf  :  Jump to search char on buffer
-  "n", "v" sc  :  Jump to search char on current line
```

### Drawing

Drawing with neovim is a cool feature when writing Markdown documents.

[venn](https://github.com/jbyuki/venn.nvim) implements this very cool feature.

Press `<leader>5` to open Venn, then try `<c-j/k/h/l>` to draw lines.

Select an area with `<c-v>` and press `f` or `b` you will get a solid or hollow box.

### Copillot
